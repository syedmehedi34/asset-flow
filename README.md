## React Fundamental and Advanced Concepts Used

1.  **JSX (JavaScript XML)**: Enables writing HTML-like syntax directly within JavaScript, making the UI more readable and declarative.

2.  **Conditional Rendering**: Dynamically displays components based on specific conditions, such as displaying loading indicators or product details based on availability.
3.  **Lists and Keys**: Efficiently renders lists of items (like products) with unique keys for optimised rendering and identification.
4.  **Context API**: Provides a way to share global state across multiple components, avoiding prop drilling (useful for shared data like user authentication and cart data).
5.  **React Router**:

    - **useLocation**: Retrieves the current location object, helpful for conditional rendering based on the current route or page.
    - **useNavigate**: Allows programmatic navigation between pages (e.g., redirecting to the checkout page after adding items to the cart).
    - **useLoaderData** (if using React Router v6): Fetches data for a particular route before rendering, ensuring that essential data is loaded ahead of time.

6.  **Lifecycle Methods with Hooks**: Utilize `useEffect` to handle side effects such as data fetching, updating the DOM, or subscribing to external events.
7.  **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client used for making API requests to interact with the server and fetch or send data. Axios is used for getting blog data, posting user comments, and handling authentication-related requests. It simplifies the process of handling HTTP requests and responses, making it more efficient and scalable.
8.  **Stripe Payment Gateway**: Integrated for secure and seamless online payment processing. Used to handle subscriptions, product purchases, and payment confirmation with real-time feedback.
9.  **Custom Hooks**: Developed reusable hooks to simplify and encapsulate logic for tasks like API calls, authentication status, and form validation.
10. **Form Handling with Validation**: Built interactive forms using React's controlled components to manage inputs, with real-time validation for user convenience.
11. **Error Handling**: Implemented global error handling for API requests and route transitions, providing meaningful feedback via alerts or toast notifications.
12. **Optimized Rendering**: Used memoization (`React.memo` and `useCallback`) to optimize performance by preventing unnecessary renders of components.

### Data Handling and Management

1.  **Context API**: Manages global state for data like user authentication and shopping cart, accessible across components.
2.  **Local Storage**: Local storage used for locally store some users information for the best user experience.
